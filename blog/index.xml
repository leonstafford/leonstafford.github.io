      <description>In a tired, but inspired state, after attending this weekend&amp;rsquo;s WordCamp Brisbane 2018.
Got to start with a big shout-out to all of the organizers, volunteers, speakers and attendees - THANK YOU!
I&amp;rsquo;m far from a WordPress fanboi - I regularly talk people out of using self-hosted WordPress. As a tech industry professional, I feel responsible to not push everyone to use a certain technology unless it makes sense. For someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in learning development and being responsible for security and performance of their server (or willing to pay someone else to be), I&amp;rsquo;d much sooner advise them to check-out a hosted platform, be it WordPress.</description>
