## Technology professional helping organisations create a better world

An almost 20 year veteran of the software industry, I thrive on technical challenges. 

It's never been fulfilling for me simply to make money and be a consumer. I see problems and I fix them. I see inefficiencies and I optimise them.

We are at an era of massive wasteage, both of our natural resources and in our potential to create a world better than the one we came into.  

### Available to NPO's as a Development Manager

Currently doing some evil marketing work to pay the bills, whilst volunteering my time to [sleepbus.org](http://sleepbus.org) development, studying maths, programming and 3D animation and trying to advance open source projects.

A role I'm undertaking again now and realizing how much I enjoy it is as a Development Manager for an NPO. This encompasses the following responsibilities:

 - being the "man in the middle" between the business and the software team
 - doing some programming/testing/infrastructure hands on work
 - refining the product backlog and ensuring development-ready tasks are available for developers
 - engaging with the development community to find and on-board volunteers
 - design and implement efficient processes for end to end development
 - most importantly, to help
