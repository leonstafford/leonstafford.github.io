## I'm a [computery guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9FGgwCQ22w)

In former lives, I've donned the hats of antiquarian book dealer, test automation guy, tech consultant, foodbank volunteer, underground craps croupier, Japanese "host", kindergarten teacher, programmer, used computer dealer, copy-boy, waiter, bi-lingual receptionist, opal salesman, tour guide, cleaner.

### Available to NPO's as a Development Manager

Currently doing some evil marketing work to pay the bills, whilst volunteering my time to [sleepbus.org](http://sleepbus.org) development, studying maths, programming and 3D animation and trying to advance open source projects.

A role I'm undertaking again now and realizing how much I enjoy it is as a Development Manager for an NPO. This encompasses the following responsibilities:

 - being the "man in the middle" between the business and the software team
 - doing some programming/testing/infrastructure hands on work
 - refining the product backlog and ensuring development-ready tasks are available for developers
 - engaging with the development community to find and on-board volunteers
 - design and implement efficient processes for end to end development
 - most importantly, to help 

I'll be seeking out other organizations in need of such help in unpaid and looking to fundraise my own support, so as not to have to do paid work for less socially benefitting companies.

Help [fund me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/leonstaffford), even $1 is a help!

## My boat-floaters

 - overcoming technical challenges
 - philosophising about humanity
 - experiencing other cultures

### Open source projects I contribute to

 - [WordPress Static HTML Output plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/) Benefit from WordPress as a CMS but with the speed, performance and portability of a static site
 - [WordPress Flexible CSV Importer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-flexible-csv-importer/) Fills a gap between the over-priced CSV importers and the limited free ones. In last stages of development before first release.
  - [CLI RSS Reader](https://github.com/lotz84/cli-rss-reader) Is what I'm using to learn me a Haskell

### Essays (WIP)

 - [The true cost of everything](/essays/true_cost.html) Should vegans become rocks to minimize their impact on the earth and our ears?
 - [What I believe](/essays/what_i_believe.html) Proofless acceptance and self-justification
