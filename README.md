## Technology professional trying to redeem myself through positive change

An almost 20 year veteran of the software industry, I thrive on technical challenges. 

We are at an era of massive wasteage, both of our natural resources and in our potential to create a world better than the one we came into.  

It's never been fulfilling for me simply to make money and be a consumer. I see problems and I fix them. I see inefficiencies and I optimise them.

I'm fortunate to have been given the opportunity, knowledge and skills to make a difference - let's work together towards making the most of the world.  

### Current ventures I'm involved with

 - [sleepbus.org](http://sleepbus.org) - I assist in the capacity of a Development Manager
 - [BeautifulMoalboal](https://www.beautifulmoalboal.org) - Partner in a new social venture

### Open source projects I maintain

 - [https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/]() WordPress Static HTML Output - a plugin to secure and speedup your WordPress install
 - [WP Flexible CSV Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-flexible-csv-importer/) Something that solved a problem for me and may help someone else
