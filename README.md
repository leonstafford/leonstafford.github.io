## I'm a [computery guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9FGgwCQ22w)

In former lives, I've donned the hats of antiquarian book dealer, test automation guy, tech consultant, foodbank volunteer, underground craps croupier, Japanese "host", kindergarten teacher, programmer, used computer dealer, copy-boy, waiter, bi-lingual receptionist, opal salesman, tour guide, cleaner.

### Hire me if you are doing something good for humanity

Currently doing some evil marketing work to pay the bills, whilst volunteering my time to [sleepsbus.org](http://sleepsbus.org) development, studying maths, programming and 3D animation and trying to advance open source projects.   

## My boat-floaters

 - overcoming technical challenges
 - philosophising about humanity
 - experiencing other cultures

### Open source projects I contribute to

 - [WordPress Static HTML Output plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/) Benefit from WordPress as a CMS but with the speed, performance and portability of a static site
 - [WordPress Flexible CSV Importer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-flexible-csv-importer/) Fills a gap between the over-priced CSV importers and the limited free ones. In last stages of development before first release.
  - [CLI RSS Reader](https://github.com/lotz84/cli-rss-reader) Is what I'm using to learn me a Haskell

### Essays (WIP)

 - [The true cost of everything](#) Should vegans become rocks to minimize their impact on the earth and our ears?
 - [The CLI can set us free](#) Who really needs a new computer?
