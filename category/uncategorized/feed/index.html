<p>AKA – Where have I been the last 4 months?</p>



<p>Wow, where do I start? My last post left off with some late night snacks in office #2 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701033049/http://zalora.com.ph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZALORA Philippines</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701033049/http://www.rocket-internet.de/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocket Internet GmbH</a>
 venture. Since then, we’ve moved offices again, largely to accommodate 
the ~100 developers I hired, along with a massive pool of image 
retouchers and content writers, all servicing the Southeast Asian 
expansion of the now popular ZALORA brand of online fashion.</p>



<p>Hiring developers for a startup is an exciting, fast paced adventure.
 Hiring 100 developers, system engineers and software quality assurance 
staff in a few months, I definitely learned a lot about the local 
talent, Philippine’s labor law and industry competitiveness. The latter 
of these bore the fruit of a Cease &amp; Desist letter from another 
large development center here, along with other companies implementing 
lock-down procedures on their staff once they knew a few had jumped ship
 to the infamous Rocket Internet.</p>



<p>The quality of developers available in Manila definitely varies, as 
it does in any country, but for economic reasons, Manila is one of the 
best places to setup a development team. English is spoken here as a 
second language (ESL), a foreign language (EFL) as it is in any other 
asian countries. The western influence here also means there is less 
culture gap between Europeans and Pinoys as there is in say China or 
Indonesia. Until recently though, most operations here have been over 
exploiting the cheap labor force here and so many of the most talented 
developers are either being swept up by higher paying companies in 
Japan, Singapore, Australia, USA, etc. Those who can’t or don’t want to 
travel often find the great opportunity and higher rates that 
onlineĀ&nbsp;freelance work offers (as I’ve always been a big proponent of).</p>



<p>I’m very happy with the people who joined us in establishing one of 
the biggest development centers in Manila and which should only grow to 
serve the ever expanding network of Rocket Internet ventures globally.</p>



<p>Once hiring got to a certain point, it was time to really look at 
optimizing development processes and balancing the agility of a startup 
with the business demands of a company with many investors and 
stakeholders. This is where I was definitely out of my comfort zone. I’d
 managed small development teams and virtual products before, but here 
we were with 100 developers, 8 products spread across asia, with 
hundreds of staff on the ground in each country supporting operations, 
liaising with stake holders in Singapore, China and head office in 
Germany. Tensions were high with conflicting aims of the micro-managing 
waterfall model of software development most familiar to traditional 
project managers, while aiming to be a rapid, “agile” startup 
development hub. It’s going to be an evolutionary process for quite a 
while longer, but it is amazing to see how far things have come from 
when the first few developers came on board around 3 months ago.</p>



<p>Other than my career with Rocket Internet, I’ve managed to find a few
 hours recently to reconnect with my contacts in the social 
entrepreneurial space here in Manila, doing a preliminary meeting for a 
planned startup community which went well and ended as it should with 
bbq and beer! Stay tuned for big announcements for the first official 
event coming up soon. Startup founder friends and other key people are 
already on board, as are a large number of developers, designers and 
other talent ready to make a name for the Philippines as an emerging 
tech startup scene.</p>



<p>Personally, my kids are back in school, I need to be back in the gym,
 but have found a new stress relief in the form of pistol shooting. 
Something I wouldn’t have imagined myself doing, but becoming highly 
addicted to it thanks to a friend and his Glock .40 calibre. Time to 
revisit my Tagalog lessons which were put on hold when joining the 
startup blitz with Rocket Internet 4 months ago.</p>

<p>Starting with one of the pros above, which is being treated to a rack
 of ribs, chips, baked beans, garlic bread and like 7 different sauces 
from Racks in Manila. This is in reward for one of the cons – working 
late on Sunday night!</p>



<p>I’ve always been a workaholic and dealt with short deadline tasks for
 lots of clients before, so the fast-paced chaos at one of the 
internet’s most notorious start-up machines is right up my alley. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://leonstafford.com/2012/03/11/pros-and-cons-of-working-with-rocket-internet/#more-683">Continue reading →</a></p>

<p>So you wanna be a web rockstar? </p>



<p>I’m sitting here in my new office in Pasig Co.Lab Xchange, writing up
 my current client-work on the whiteboard… somehow I went from 2 clients
 at start of year to 7 within the last week or two… plus my social 
project and own in-house development work needing doing…</p>



<p>I thought to myself now, it would be great to bring someone young, 
fresh and full of energy who wants to be baptised by digital fire and 
learn the best way possible!</p>



<p>So, internship anyone?? </p>



<p>Must have:</p>



<p>&#8211; laptop<br>
&#8211; energy<br>
&#8211; motivation<br>
&#8211; sense of adventure<br>
&#8211; some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP<br>
&#8211; oDesk account<br>
&#8211; 4,500 Pesos + travel costs</p>



<p>The pesos are to cover your rental office space here, which is 4,500 
for 1 month. You will be reimbursed this amount via oDesk, earning a 
daily rate enough to cover your office rent and travel expenses for the 
month (within reasonable amount).</p>



<p>Work hours are from 10am until 8pm, Monday to Friday with me in the 
office and then I’ll set you “homework tasks” as required if I feel you 
need to study more on something. You will be learning by working, the 
best way!</p>



<p>After the first month, if we’re getting along and you are showing 
some development, this will likely turn into a fulltime paid position.</p>



<p>I can probably accept up to 3 people simultaneously, so anyone up for adventure, let me know, you can start tomorrow!</p>



<p>**Cheap food, same as what I eat, will be provided, as is all you can drink coffee..!</p>

<p>Until just now though, this blog had been spending a nice relaxing break being hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701005055/http://wordpress.com/">WordPess.com</a>.
 While that allowed me to easily add posts without getting my hands 
dirty, it took me too far away from the code I’d invested so much time 
to initially develop.</p>



<p>So, here it goes, this website has been exported out of 
WordPress.com, imported into my development server and now as you read 
this is being served in a purely static HTML form.</p>



<p>It will take me a little while to redo a WordPress theme better suited to this lean mean static machine, but bear with me!</p>



<p>Comments are now back to using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701005055/http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> embedded Javascript widgets and the XML feed may need revamping, too, but c’mon, who really reads RSS feeds?!?</p>

<p>As I’ve switched from my MacBook Air to a used Fujitsu laptop at 
1/12th its price, I’ve been trying to squeeze as much performance from 
this beast as possible.</p>



<p>The specs:</p>



<p>Fujitsu FMV-B8200<br> Pentium-M &nbsp;1.2Ghz<br> 512MB RAM<br> 20GB HDD<br> 12.1TFT @ 1024×768<br> 1.19 kgs</p>



<p>Installed the only DVD I had distro I had on hand, which was Ubuntu Alternative (desktop edition).</p>



<p>For tweaking performance with minimal effort, the main things I’ve 
done so far are switch to the Fluxbox window manager. This DRMATICALLY 
improves performance, removing basically any lag I was suffering under 
Gnome. I’d used Fluxbox or IceWM or another lightweight window manager 
in the past when using Linux as my main work machine, the only thing I 
really needed to do was remember a few shortcuts and tweak some key 
commands.</p>



<p>Set a shortcut key for the menu:</p>



<p>Rather than trying to find an empty space on the desktop to 
right-click and bring up the main Fluxbox menu, I set a key binding to 
the Winblowz key + F5 to open it no matter what app I happen to be in at
 the time, this saved me a LOT of time instantly.</p>



<p>The file for changing key bindings is located at:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">~<strong>/</strong>.fluxbox<strong>/</strong>keys</pre>



<p>Just copy and paste some bits, I used:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># key to bring up menu: Mod4 F5 :RootMenu</pre>



<p>The other keyboard shortcut I really needed to know was Alt + F1, which brings up a Terminal window.</p>



<p>Playing music from command line:</p>



<p>Using mplayer from the command line to save resources and wanting a 
quick way to play a folder’s worth of songs recursively, I found this 
command works like a charm:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>mplayer</strong> -playlist <strong>&lt;</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>find</strong> "$PWD" -type f<strong>)</strong></pre>



<p>I find that having easy access to music while working makes everything go smoother!</p>



<p>**Just be sure to test your output is going only to your headphones, 
not speakers when working out in public, I just took out my headphones 
to realize everyone had been listening to my playlist the last 30mins, 
oops!</p>

<p>Having just sold my MacBook Air yesterday and aiming to inspire 
prospective online workers here in the Philippines to keep costs low, I 
went looking for a capable laptop for or less than 5,000 PHP.</p>



<p>While somethings are cheap in the Philippines, computers are not one 
of them! Compared to Japan’s flooded and thriving used PC market, it is 
hard to find such a wide selection here.</p>



<p>I ended up at Gilmore, Manila’s largest computer district (I 
believe). Asking around for somewhere I could get a sub-5k laptop, I was
 directed to “MIP Desktop &amp; Laptop Computers Trading”, where an 
Angel (that’s her name actually) finally reduced 2,000 PHP from the 
price of one laptop for me, knowing I wouldn’t leave there without a 5k 
or lower machine!</p>



<p>The laptop acquired is a Fujitsu FMV-B8200 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120703052331/http://www.fmworld.net/biz/fmv/product/hard/blb0504/b8200">http://www.fmworld.net/biz/fmv/product/hard/blb0504/b8200</a>/),
 which basically met my pre-determined minimum requirements of 512MB, 12
 (vs 13) inch screen, well thats basically all I was worried about… It 
has Wifi, lots of inputs n outputs, fingerprint scanner and good working
 battery, but those are all extras. </p>



<p>This machine will be more than capable of being my main work machine,
 with Xubuntu alternative ISO downloading now to allow me to install a 
stripped down, fast version of Linux.</p>



<p>I’ll be posting a bunch of guides on what software to use for various
 development or admin tasks I’ll be doing as an online worker, along 
with other tips for working online CHEAPLY.</p>



<p>No reason not to also do this if you are living in a “developed” country, either!</p>

<p>Yes, back by no particular demand and following up to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/super-beginner-tagalog-filipino-language/">Super beginner Tagalog (Filipino language)</a>, I’m recording here some new words I may have heard or read in a book since then.</p>



<p><em>bagong</em> – new</p>



<p>I first read this in&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Speaks-Perfectly-Tagalog-ebook/dp/B005K8XBCQ">Nobody Speaks Perfectly Tagalog – English [Kindle Edition]</a>,
 and the next day was able to understand a whole sentence including it 
in a Western Union poster (something about “This is your new wallet”, 
some kinda cash card deal..).</p>



<p>Reinforced last night by my kuya, RDR, when he was the only one to greet me with:</p>



<p><em>Maligayang Bagong Taon!</em> – Happy New Year!</p>



<p>As he was the only one to greet me with that, I’m feeling a bit 
lonely here in PI and need to make some local friends after already 3 
days here…</p>



<p><em>ito</em> – this</p>



<p>As seen in such phrases as:</p>



<p><em>magkano ito?</em> – how much is this?</p>



<p><em>ako/ko</em> – I</p>



<p>I’m quite scared of how my brain will deal with the different grammar rules for Filipino, such as when to use <em>ako</em> or <em>ko</em>, but I’m assuming the more I can get actual conversation practice, it will make more sense… that goes for all the <em>ng</em>‘s and <em>mga</em>‘s, too, which I think I can at least pronounce…</p>



<p>OK, now for some community recommendations from my last post, I’ll take the ones I’ve heard before:</p>



<p><em>gatas</em> – milk</p>



<p>Thanks to my Filipina friends in Hong Kong and the fact I only had <em>gatas</em> or Tanduay in my house to drink (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/a-tanduay-christmas/">this post</a> to learn the fate of my Tanduay bottle…)</p>



<p><em>hindi</em> – not</p>



<p>This one was easy to remember from a book, denotes negativity, 
reminds me of Bollywood (apologies if I got the ethnicities wrong!)</p>



<p><em>bayan</em> – town</p>



<p><em>balik</em> – return</p>



<p>I had heard this one as <em>balikbayan</em>, I think at Manila 
airport, there was a counter for OFW (Overseas Foreign Workers), perhaps
 it was written here..? Can someone tell me if <em>babalik</em> is the shortened version of <em>balikbayan</em>? Anyway, <em>balikbayan</em> seems to be synonymous with OFW’s returning home. If you start to type “<em>balikb</em>…” into Google, it’s auto-complete suggests <em>balikbayan</em> box New York, <em>balikbayan</em> box Honalulu, etc…</p>



<p>tubig – water</p>



<p>I haven’t remembered this one yet, but have heard it a few times… 
I’ll be careful not to mistake it as English “too big”, especially as a 
white guy in asia..</p>



<p><em>kamusta (ka)? – how are you?</em></p>



<p>Very easy to remember from the Spanish&nbsp;¿Cómo estás?</p>



<p><em>salamat (po)</em> – Thank you</p>



<p>I’ve kind of never used this, I would feel so like a tourist using 
this anywhere that people obviously speak English (99% of Manila??) Once
 I have a few more phrases under my belt though, I will be fine to throw
 it out there, hoping to catch a response in Tagalog to get a 
conversation started…</p>



<p><em>saan?</em> – where?</p>



<p>This one has another hint inside, which is sa, used as a 
“particle”(?) for direction, similar to に(ni) in Japanese, or 在(sai/hai)
 in Mandarin/Cantonese. Let’s see the same particle in a sentence that 
will introduce another word:</p>



<p><em>gusto ko pumunta sa tubig</em> – I want to go to the water</p>



<p>Maybe not a common phrase, but I wanted to throw water in there and introduce 2 more words:</p>



<p><em>gusto</em> – want/like</p>



<p><em>pumunta</em>/<em>punta</em> – go</p>



<p>This is where it gets tricky for me… punta supposedly means direction, but then the verb changes for each tense here:</p>



<p><em>Saan ang punta mo?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Where you going?</p>



<p><em>Saan ka pupunta?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Where are you going?</p>



<p><em>Pumunta ka ba kahapon?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Did you go yesterday?</p>



<p>That’s too much for me to remember the rules just yet.</p>



<p><em>ano</em>/<em>anong</em> – what?</p>



<p>A Filipina co-worker taught me this one, thanks! I kept hearing her 
say it over the phone (work calls, I’m sure!). This also changes 
deepening on the following word’s first letter, if it is a vowel or 
consonant, I believe.</p>



<p>A lot of those last ones were from a random visitor, who was actually looking for info on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/wordpress-static-html-output-plugin/">WordPress plugin</a>!</p>



<p>To wrap up, a couple of verbs I’ve heard, but don’t know how to 
properly conjugate. I’ll pay them a conjugal visit in the future, 
perhaps…</p>



<p><em>nagluluto</em> – cooking</p>



<p><em>baboy</em> – pork</p>



<p>I was trying to be clever and typed <em>nagluluto ay baboy</em> into 
Google translate, it told me I was this clever: “cooks are breeding”. 
Seems “pork” has same connotations in Tagalog as English, hehe!</p>



<p>Actually, I’m out of verbs, just this last phrase:</p>



<p><em>anong oras na</em> – what time is it?</p>



<p>The <em>na</em> and maybe <em>ka</em> seem similar to Japanese for making something a question, i.e. <em>xxxxxx ka na</em>?</p>



<p>OK, a bit of a long post, seems I’ve remembered a few more words in 
the last couple of days. Could really use some help with the grammar and
 verbiage next round of comments!</p>

<p>Just landed in Manila today and the woeful internet speed made me 
remember my time working in mainland China. In between lashings and 
being force-fed propaganda cornflakes for breakfast, it was a daily 
struggle to get reliable internet connectivity in our office.</p>



<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>
 is an awesome FreeBSD-based router/firewall/swiss army knife of digital
 bliss which allowed our multiple expensive, crappy aDSL lines to band 
together and form one uber-line. At the time, we were using 
load-balancing, meaning it would send and receive packets evenly over 
each connection (or use a ratio we defined for stronger/weaker lines). 
This meant that more users could be surfing porn in the office at the 
same time and downloading torrents was like super fast man. There may 
have been increased business benefits, too, but really, well-porned 
workers are good workers is what I always say (just not out loud in 
China or I would get beaten with a stick).</p>



<p>I may setup another pfSense box here in Manila at some point if I could find some old hardware and afford extra aDSL(ow) lines.</p>



<p>DISCLAIMER: I don’t really do such cheeky stuff as download torrents, I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZB">NZBs</a>!</p>

<p>So… trying to get back to my family in Manila before Christmas, 
waiting on new passport to arrive in the Australia consulate, Hong Kong.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I thought I should get some basics down in Tagalog, of which I know only a few words.</p>



<p>In my defense, I speak, read and write fluent Japanese and can speak a
 little Mandarin. Tagalog, unfortunately, suffers from the same study 
difficulties as does Cantonese, in that so many people speak English as a
 first language in Philippines as in Hong Kong.</p>



<p>Let’s start out with trying to think of all the few words I’ve 
remembered so far in Tagalog over the years of having Filipino friends 
and in recently going to PI:</p>



<p><em>mahal</em> – love</p>



<p>I was confident I knew this meant love, as my Filipino buddy had told
 me the important words mahal kita in case I ever dated a Filipina 
(secret!), which I believed meant “I love you”, but at least mahal was 
love I was sure… I also met a Pinoy in Japan who had named his son Mahal
 and told me again the meaning…</p>



<p><em>mahal kita</em> – I love you?</p>



<p>So, then I thought this one translated to “I love you” or such, but was a very long time ago I was taught it, so Googled it and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160601/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mahal%20kita">urbandictionary.com</a> confirmed it as “I love you”.</p>



<p>Cool, two words so far – superstar! Ok, so looking at the above 
phrase, knowing mahal is love, what does the kita mean? According to 
tagaloglang.com, it means “I to you” (e.g. papaliguan kita – I will give
 you a bath)</p>



<p>Anything else I remember in my vast tagalogabulary? Sure:</p>



<p><em>magkano</em> – How much? (price)</p>



<p>I had to lookup the spelling on this one, but I remembered the 
roundabout pronunciation.. I’d overheard friends saying this a few times
 and asked about it. Stuck in my memory due to this…</p>



<p><em>tita</em> – Auntie (endearment)</p>



<p>OK, again, learnt this one from my Filipino buddy and he had told me 
it meant auntie, which knowing what I did of Filipino culture, assumed 
anyone female who took care of you, not necessarily blood. Looking 
online, seems it is the literal translation of aunt, but also a term of 
endearment for an (older than oneself) lady. The magical Google also 
showed me the mail/uncle version would be tito, doing that funky o vs a 
Spanish thing to word endings..</p>



<p><em>ate</em> – older sister</p>



<p>I think I may have learnt this one while in Shenhen, China, from our 
first pinay DH (domestic helper), but my memory is fuzzy, could have 
been later in Hong Kong… In Hong Kong, seeing more Filipinas everyday, 
they often refer to their seniors/girlfriends as ate. Now, I have a 
nanny for my kids in Manila, whose name is Girlie. We call her “Ate 
girlie” to mean big sister</p>



<p><em>kuya</em> – older brother</p>



<p>This one I remembered from my brief time in Manila so far. Ate Girlie had taught my kids that this is what we call guys. </p>



<p><em>Pinoy</em> – Filipino</p>



<p>OK, so I have some ignorance on this one, but generally knew it meant
 Filipino and was used by Filipinos themselves. So, in Googling, I’m 
told there is no “F” in Filipino (which I’m also being told is a 
combination of Tagalog, Spanish and English)… So should really call PI 
people Pilipino rather than Filipino? It is less formal than Pilipino 
and can also swing both ways, with pinoy working the male/female 
meanings and pinay exclusively meaning female Pilipina.</p>



<p><em>sige</em> – OK</p>



<p>I’m not hundred percent on this, but think it means OK/sure. I always
 heard PI people use it on the telephone or in sentences which sounded 
like they were saying OK in response to something…</p>



<p><em>gising</em> – awake</p>



<p>I learnt this one from being treated to a great Pampanga dish called gising gising.</p>



<p><em>mabuhay</em> – welcome / long live</p>



<p>This is on a lot of the tourism media when you arrive in the PI. It 
seems to be also used as a patriotic cry, but I may be way off there..</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s about all of my limited words learnt in 
Pilipino/Tagalog until now and I’ll make an effort to actually learn to 
speak like a local as I’ll be spending more time in PI from now and am 
looking forward to experiencing the culture more.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have recommendations for the next most important words/phrases I should learn next  </p>
