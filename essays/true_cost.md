# The true cost of everything

> Should vegans become rocks to minimize their impact on the earth and our ears?

They may not answer in the affirmative to that, but where does their limit lie?

## Sidetrack - Extremes and balances

I tend to look at and often live in extremes, something I've become more aware of with a partner who notices these kinds of things.

 - a hoarder or my life's in my backpack
 - obsessively vegan or binging on terrible food
 - procrastinating or melded to the computer 

The above highlight behaviours, but this also hits me when philosophizing about society and humanity. 

 - If someone recycles their household trash in an effort to reduce harmful waste, should they not then live in rammed earth homes, without appliances and grow their own food?
 - If one forgoes eating animals due to them being alive, should this not also extend to plants and the microbes in the water the consume?

Perhaps my struggle with the concept of ideal balance, is then where does hypocrisy come into play? 

> the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case

OK, so perhaps that is only when someone claims to be doing a great service by recycling their plastic water bottles, when not buying into the bottled water industry would be more beneficial?
