# The true cost of everything

> Should vegans become rocks to minimize their impact on the earth and our ears?

They may not answer in the affirmative to that, but where does their limit lie?

## Sidetrack - Extremes and balances

I tend to look at and often live in extremes, something I've become more aware of with a partner who notices these kinds of things.

 - a hoarder or my life's in my backpack
 - obsessively vegan or binging on terrible food
 - procrastinating or melded to the computer 

The above highlight behaviours, but this also hits me when philosophizing about society and humanity. 

 - If someone recycles their household trash in an effort to reduce harmful waste, should they not then live in rammed earth homes, without appliances and grow their own food?
 - If one forgoes eating animals due to them being alive, should this not also extend to plants and the microbes in the water the consume?

Perhaps my struggle with the concept of ideal balance, is then where does hypocrisy come into play? 

> the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case

OK, so perhaps that is only when someone claims to be doing a great service by recycling their plastic water bottles, when not buying into the bottled water industry would be more beneficial?

Granted, not as many people tell you about how great a recycler they are.

Vegans, on the other hand...

That maybe clears it up for me, I may have been judging people as hypocrites, when they weren't openly claiming to be more noble than their actions.

So, let's then get back to the humble act of recycling - how much is enough? How much would be enough to appease my societal judgements (even though, by doing so, I'm enobling myself to hypocrite status)? 

In software development, we love to push back when receiving feedback that a webpage is "loading too slow". The flaw being the "too", implying there is some perfect yet unspoken amount time that a webpage should load in. It is all *too* common to solicit "How many seconds should it load in?" to the reporter, only to receive "I don't know, just not that slow!". Instantly would be ideal, though theoretically impossible(?). A few milliseconds, then? Sure, but it will cost an extra $1 million for our site to load that quickly. OK, now we have another scale to slide along with our speed, we have cost. Maybe, in this case, we can throw quality in for the usual trifecta - we can load the webpage quicker if we take out some of the content and usefulness of it. 

You can see where I'm heading now. Maybe the hypothetical person I previously judged harshly for their poor environmental net impact, has compromised on this one metric in order to boost others, which add value to society? Without going into the danger-zone of the meaning of life, let's take a stab at the values of soceity: to survive and thrive? In this case, perhaps being a bit lackadaisical with polluting the environment the society needs for survival, is in order to make better progress in the sciences to keep us alive or to focus more on reproduction?

 - buying a bottle of water saves a few minutes of drinking from the faucet, those minutes then make the difference to someone's study time needed to achieve the next breakthrough for humanity?

At a stretch, perhaps - depending on how much water this person drinks and how sciency they are. And if they were the one to discover the plastic eating wax worms - it may just balance out. 

More often though, we can look outside (or within our own homes) and see many examples of an apparent compromise, or accepted level of complacency with regards to conservation of our human habitat.
