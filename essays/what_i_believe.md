# What I believe

> Proofless acceptance and self-justification

Written more for my children and partner to help understand my actions.

### There is no spoon

"What's the point?" can often be exasperated in moments of depression. Rather than it's usual negative lamentation, leading to frustration at the lack of evidential answers, we can choose to embrace it for the beauty of it's limitless depth.

### King's Quest

Yep, I love referencing old computer games. I spent so many hours in youth watching television, playing computer games and otherwise being distracted without caring about the meaningless of life. 

I started asking the big questions around 20, while being involved in volunteer work in Japan. It was the first time outside of the media that I was exposed to the victims of society. Seeing people walk over homeless without glancing or playing big brother to a sexually abused 8 year old boy. At first, I felt good for helping. Then I felt guilty about feeling good. 

My mentor at the time gave me some sage advice as I questioned whether there was any such thing as a selfless act. He mentioned people finding different ways to feel alive, be it racing fast cars, doing extreme sports, making as much money as possible or giving to the less fortunate. Having tried all those things at times (less so, the extreme sports), none gave me a magical answer to my existence, but now coming back to giving of myself for others, it feels a more fulfilling way to spend the days.
